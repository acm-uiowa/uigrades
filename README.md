## Disclaimer
UIGrades is an objective data-based tool for students to visualize past semester courses' grade distributions at the University of Iowa. If youâ€™re using UIGrades to select classes to take, please use it in conjunction with MyUI. Grade distributions are not necessarily an indicator of course difficulty nor a reflection on the instructor or department rewarding those grades. There are several factors that determine the ultimate grade distribution of a course, difficulty being only one. Additionally, UIGrades is not a substitute for an advising appointment. Please see your designated academic advisor for questions about your proposed course schedule.
